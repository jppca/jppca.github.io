WordPress and Drupal are two of the most popular open-source content management systems (CMS). Both are built with PHP, have strong communities, and power millions of websites. However, they serve different use cases depending on the project’s needs.

### ⚙️ Technical Overview

WordPress is known for its simplicity and quick setup. It's perfect for blogs, small business sites, and content-focused platforms. With over 60,000 plugins and a massive theme ecosystem, it allows non-developers to build functional sites with minimal code.

Drupal is designed for complex, structured content and scalability. It includes powerful tools for content modeling (entities, fields, taxonomies), multilingual support, and API-first architecture (JSON:API, GraphQL, REST). It's better suited for enterprise projects, government platforms, and higher education websites.

### 🔒 Security & Performance

Drupal has a strong security reputation and is often used in environments where data protection is critical.

WordPress, while secure at its core, is more vulnerable due to the wide use of third-party plugins — requiring more careful management.

### 🎯 Use the Right Tool

If your goal is to launch a site quickly with a simple structure, WordPress is a great choice.

If your project needs advanced customization, user roles, multilingual features, and high performance at scale, Drupal is likely the better fit.

Both are powerful platforms — choosing between them depends on your project’s complexity, team skills, and future growth plans.
