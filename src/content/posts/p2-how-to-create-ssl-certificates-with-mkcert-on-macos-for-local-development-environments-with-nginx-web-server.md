Today SSL is practically a standard and most applications rely heavily on it. By running SSL on your local machine, the environment is more production-like, which makes testing and development much easier. It also allows you to run services that require it, such as GoogleMaps API location services, for example.

mkcert is a simple tool for making locally-trusted development certificates. It automatically creates and installs a local CA in the system root store, and generates locally-trusted certificates.

### Step 1:
#### Install mkcert.

To start the installation you will use the brew package manager in MacOS.
**command:**

```bash
brew install mkcert
brew install nss # if you use Firefox or Chrome.
```

Install the local CA in the system trust store.
**command:**

```bash
mkcert -install
```
### Step 2:
#### Generate the certificates.

To generate the local SSL certificate we must place the mkcert command and the local domain defined for your environment.
In this case we will use the example of `local.test` as the domain.
**command:**

```bash
mkcert local.test
```

### Step 3:
#### Update the virtual host configuration in NGINX.
