Today SSL is practically a standard and most applications rely heavily on it. By running SSL on your local machine, the environment is more production-like, which makes testing and development much easier. It also allows you to run services that require it, such as GoogleMaps API location services, for example.

mkcert is a simple tool for making locally-trusted development certificates. It automatically creates and installs a local CA in the system root store, and generates locally-trusted certificates.

### Step 1:
#### Install mkcert.
**command:**

To start the installation you will use the brew package manager in MacOS.

```bash
brew install mkcert
brew install nss # if you use Firefox or Chrome.
```
